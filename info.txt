Explanation:

Data Generation: Generate or collect data for control and experiment groups.
Statistical Analysis: Calculate means and standard deviations for both groups.
Hypothesis Testing: Perform a t-test to compare the means of the two groups.
Decision Making: Determine if the difference between the groups is statistically significant based on the p-value.
Additional Considerations:

Power Analysis: Calculate the sample size required for a desired power level.
Multiple Testing: Adjust p-values for multiple comparisons if testing multiple hypotheses.
Effect Size: Calculate effect size to quantify the magnitude of the difference.
Confidence Intervals: Calculate confidence intervals for the difference in means.
